# Student Dropout and Academic Success Prediction

A Flask-based REST API that predicts student dropout probability and academic performance using machine learning. This service analyzes various student attributes to provide insights into academic outcomes and retention risks.

## Problem Description

Student dropout and academic underperformance are significant challenges in higher education institutions, impacting both the students' futures and institutional effectiveness. Early identification of at-risk students is crucial for implementing timely interventions and support systems.

This project addresses these challenges by developing a **machine learning model that predicts both student dropout probability and academic performance**. The model analyzes various demographic, social, economic, and academic factors to generate accurate predictions.

By leveraging historical student data and advanced analytics, institutions can proactively identify students who may need additional support, enabling targeted interventions before academic issues become critical.

The solution provides a **REST API interface** that allows educational institutions to easily integrate these predictive capabilities into their existing student management systems, making it practical for real-world applications.

The model considers multiple factors including enrollment data, academic performance, socio-economic indicators, and previous educational background to provide comprehensive insights into student success patterns.

## Project overview

#### What Does the Student Success Predictor Do?

The **Student Success Predictor** uses classical machine learning techniques to predict student dropout probability and academic performance. Key aspects include:

- **Multiple Model Evaluation**: The project evaluated several classical ML models including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost

- **Model Selection**: After comprehensive testing and validation, **Random Forest** was selected as the final model due to its:
  - Superior prediction ROC-AUC
  - Ability to handle both numerical and categorical features
  - Robustness against overfitting
  - Feature importance insights

- **Feature Engineering**: The model processes various types of input data:
  - Demographic information (age, gender, nationality)
  - Academic history (previous qualifications, first semester performance)
  - Socio-economic indicators (parent's education, scholarship status)
  - Enrollment details (course type, attendance mode)

- **Practical Implementation**: The system provides:
  - Multiclass classification
  - REST API for easy integration with existing systems
  - Real-time predictions for individual students
  - Batch processing capabilities for institutional-level analysis
  - Feature importance analysis for understanding key dropout factors


Sample prediction from our Flask-based REST API service:

```
input: {'curricular_units_2nd_sem_(approved)': [8], 'curricular_units_2nd_sem_(grade)': [14.07125], 'curricular_units_1st_sem_(approved)': [8], 'curricular_units_1st_sem_(grade)': [14.07125], 'tuition_fees_up_to_date': [1], 'scholarship_holder': [1], 'age_at_enrollment': [19], 'debtor': [0], 'gender': [0], 'application_mode': [1], 'curricular_units_2nd_sem_(enrolled)': [8], 'curricular_units_1st_sem_(enrolled)': [8], 'displaced': [1]}

## Containerization

1. Build and run docker image (for system dependency management)

```
docker build -t <your_dockerhub_username>/student-dropout-success .
docker images
```
**Note**: We are adding `<your_dockerhub_username>` in the name to push image to docker HUB later. Refer to [Cloud deployment](#cloud-deployment) section for more details.

2. Run the container with proper signal handling
```
docker run -it --rm \
  --name student-dropout-container \
  -p 9696:9696 \
  --stop-signal SIGTERM \
  --stop-timeout 30 \
  <your_dockerhub_username>/student-dropout-success
```
You can stop the container gracefully by:

- Using Ctrl+C if running in interactive mode
- Running `docker stop student-dropout-container` from another terminal

3. Test from another terminal

```
python predict-requests-test.py
```
Result: Same as previous step
